# 🧰 MERN Stack ToDo App — Dockerized

This project demonstrates how to **containerize a full-stack MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js)** application using Docker and Docker Compose. It includes database persistence, environment variables handling, inter-service communication, and best practices for development and deployment.

---

## 📦 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React
- **Backend**: Express.js (Node.js)
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Containerization**: Docker, Docker Compose

---

## 🔥 What You'll Learn

- How to Dockerize a React frontend using **multi-stage builds**
- How to Dockerize a Node.js/Express backend
- How to set up MongoDB with Docker volumes for persistent storage
- How to manage `.env` environment variables inside containers
- How to orchestrate multiple services using Docker Compose
- How to build, tag, and push Docker images to DockerHub

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/mern-todo-docker.git
cd mern-todo-docker
```

### 2. Create Environment Files

Make sure to place any necessary `.env` files inside the `Client` and `Backend` folders (optional if you're using hardcoded values or config).

### 3. Run Docker Compose

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This will spin up the following services:

- `mongodb` at port `27017`
- `backend` at port `3000`
- `client` at port `80`

### 4. Access the App

Visit the frontend in your browser:
**[http://localhost](http://localhost)**

---

## 🐳 Docker Compose Configuration

Here’s the `docker-compose.yml` used in this project:

```yaml
version: "3.6"
services:
  mongodb:
    container_name: mongodb
    image: mongo:latest
    expose:
      - 27017
    volumes:
      - vol-1:/data/db
    restart: always
    networks:
      - net-1

  backend:
    container_name: backend
    depends_on:
      - mongodb
    build:
      context: ./backend
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    restart: always
    ports:
      - 3000:3000
    volumes:
      - "C:/Users/rrche/Desktop/DOCKER-TESTING/Backend:/app:rw"
    networks:
      - net-1

  client:
    container_name: client
    depends_on:
      - backend
    build:
      context: ./Client
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    restart: always
    ports:
      - 80:80
    volumes:
      - "C:/Users/rrche/Desktop/DOCKER-TESTING/Client:/App:rw"
    networks:
      - net-1

volumes:
  vol-1:

networks:
  net-1:
```

## 🧱 Multi-Stage Docker Build (Frontend)

To build and serve the React app efficiently in production, we use a **multi-stage Dockerfile**. This reduces the final image size and improves performance by separating build and runtime phases.

### 🔧 Dockerfile Used for React (`/Client/Dockerfile`)

```dockerfile
# STAGE 1: Builder
FROM node:lts-alpine3.21 AS builder-stage
WORKDIR /App

# Install dependencies
COPY package*.json .
RUN npm install

# Copy source code and build app
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

# STAGE 2: Production
FROM nginx:alpine AS production-stage
COPY --from=builder-stage /App/dist /usr/share/nginx/html

EXPOSE 80
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```

### ✅ Benefits of Multi-Stage Builds

| Stage              | Purpose                            | Benefit                       |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `builder-stage`    | Builds and compiles the React code | Clean separation of dev logic |
| `production-stage` | Serves static files via Nginx      | Smaller, faster final image   |

---

## 📤 Build & Push Docker Images (Optional)

To push your images to DockerHub:

```bash
# Backend
docker build -t yourusername/backend-app ./Backend
docker push yourusername/backend-app

# Frontend
docker build -t yourusername/client-app ./Client
docker push yourusername/client-app
```

Update `docker-compose.yml` to use prebuilt images if deploying remotely.
